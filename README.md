# DiscordTV
Simultaneous youtube playback on Discord


## Roadmap

Goal features, maybe

V1: Anyone can play a video. Playing a video just starts it for everyone (interrupts current ). Close to tinychat youtube behaviour.
V2: Roles ? Queue ?
V3: Rooms ? Per-channel or at least per-server management.
